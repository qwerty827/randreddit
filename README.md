# Random Reddit (Version 1.0, created 8/25/2016)
Since I love browsing reddit whenever I'm free, I decided to build my first Chrome extension project as a button that creates a new tab of random subreddit every click.

I've created the manifest file in JSON, UI page in HTML and implemented button event logic in Javascript. In addition, I created a customized snoo icon for this extension in Adobe Photoshop.
